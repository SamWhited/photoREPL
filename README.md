# photoREPL

*photoREPL* is an experimental UI build around the [rawkit][rawkit] raw photo
editing library for Python. photoREPL drops you at a Python prompt, with a few
custom functions and a copy of rawkit imported and spawns a preview window.
That's it.

Eventually the plan is to have the preview window update automatically as you
update your photo with rawkit. This will then (hopefully) act as the proving
ground for the [PhotoShell][photoshell] REPL, or will possibly be bundled into
a library and used as the PhotoShell REPL itself.
